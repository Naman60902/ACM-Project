# Project Title : Asciify : ASCII Art Generator
ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.
In this project, I will use these ASCII for a different purpose.

# Project Description :
In this project, I will convert the images into an ASCII encoded strings art. It would look like the image. However, it will not just look like the image in terms of shape but also in colour.

Hereâ€™s an example :

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78922244/174453068-630a3934-5289-42d8-82af-5c5ff169487d.jpg" width="300" height="400"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78922244/174453249-d71b534a-802e-4ca0-8e46-428613153331.jpg" width="300" height="400"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78922244/174453076-58145cb8-6ffb-47e1-a7da-1d4648e5624e.jpg" width="300" height="400">

The first image is the original image.
The second image is an ascii encoded image with a white background.
The third image is an ascii encoded image with a black background.

In this project, I have added this concept of ascii art generation to not only on images but also to videos.
